## What is A/B testing?
A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage, app, or marketing strategy to determine which one performs better. It involves splitting a user base into two groups:
Group A is shown the original version (the control).
Group B is shown a modified version (the variation).
By analyzing how each group interacts with the version they are shown (such as by tracking clicks, conversions, or other metrics), you can determine which version is more effective at achieving a desired outcome.

A/B testing is commonly used in areas like web design, marketing campaigns, and product development to optimize performance and user experience by making data-driven decisions.

## Business Case

Facebook introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" method. With this innovation, companies like x.com, one of our clients, are planning to conduct an A/B test to evaluate whether "average bidding" results in more conversions compared to the "maximum bidding" approach.

## The story of the dataset

This dataset, containing information about a company's website, includes data such as the number of ads users have viewed and clicked on, along with the revenue generated from these ads. There are two separate datasets for the Control and Test groups. Maximum Bidding was applied to the Control group, while Average Bidding was applied to the Test group.

# Variables:
- Impression: The number of times an ad is displayed.
- Click: The number of times the displayed ad is clicked.
- Purchase: The number of products purchased after clicking on the ads.
- Earning: The revenue from the products purchased after the ads are clicked.
